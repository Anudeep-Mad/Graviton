To configure P4 in python...

  Install Perforce client P4 in UNix. 
  
  Set the env variables -- ( in .bash_profile in home dir ) 
    P4PORT = #server:port
    P4USER = user ( user with which you want to login to perforce )
    P4CLIENT = clientname ( default value will be the hostname - you can set any value )
    
    
  ----To immediately get the usage of env values set(without restarting the session) run "source .bash_profile" in home directory.
  
  run "p4 set" on terminal 
  to check for information on configuration run "p4 info" on terminal.
  
  run "p4 set config=config_file_name.txt" - to set configuration from a seperate file ( instead of env variables )
      ## Env variables must be unset for P4.. else they will override values.
